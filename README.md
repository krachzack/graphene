# graphene
Graphene is a lightweight web server implementing a small subset of the HTTP specification.

## Building and usage
Build the project with cmake and start the graphene executable.
You can select a port with the `-p 8080` switch and a document root with the
`-w ../some/../path` switch.

The server will now keep running until interrupted, e.g. by pressing `ctrl+c`.
